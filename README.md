# SoC-2021
Our progress so far:
  (1) Set up Python, Git and Jupyter Notebook.
  (2) Completed first five weeks' content of Andrew Ng's course on ML. This covered the basics of Machine Learning and CNNs which will be required in the next phase.
  (3) Completed 3 assignments based on the content covered (as mentioned in (2)). These assignments gave us the required familiarity with the NumPy, OpenCV, MatPlotLib and scikit-learn modules of Python.
